    "the currency rate table can translate to a network of nodes (currency) and edges (whose weight is the direct exchange rate between 2 node). So the problem is equivalent to finding a simple path of which the product of the weights of edges is largest. The simple path (a path passing a node only once) is included as an constraint because there is no point buying a currency then selling it for the currency we used to have.To store results computed during the bottom up process, a matrix n*n is created where c(i,j) record the largest currency to buy j using i. We number the currency we want to buy n and sell 1. For example, there are 5 provided currencies, and we want to buy Pound using USD, then USD is 1 and pound is 5. Other currencies take to any number between 1 and 5. Accordingly a matrix 5*5 is created to store the max exchange rate between 5 currencies\n",

Because if 1-2-3 is better than 1-3, the product of 1-2 and 2-3 is filled in c(1,3) not the weight of edge 1-3.\n",
    "* When |i-j| = 4, (i=1 j = 5). This is the most important cell as it tells how much at most we can buy Pound using USD. The process is similar to smaller values of |i-j|. We compute the exchange rate of all intermediate paths and get the max out of such results to fill in c(i,j)"
